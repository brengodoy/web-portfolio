	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
	Hello there! I'm Brenda, a passionate Systems Engineer with a strong focus on Machine Learning. 💻🧠 My journey in tech has been a blend of continuous learning, creative problem-solving, and building solutions that bridge the gap between technology and real-world impact. 🌍✨
	</p>
	<p>
	I’m driven by curiosity and a love for innovation, always looking for opportunities to grow both professionally and personally. 🔍🚀 Whether it's diving deep into Machine Learning, experimenting with new tools, or creating content that resonates with others, I’m committed to exploring what technology can do for the world. 🌟
	</p>
	<p>
	Beyond programming, I have a deep interest in content creation, aesthetics, and the potential of social media as a tool for building meaningful connections. 📸💬 I love to share my knowledge, whether through tutorials, insights, or simply sharing what I’m passionate about. 💖

	<p>
	✨ While I'm not a frontend expert, I'm proud to say I designed this entire website on my own! 💻🎨 This is the first project I’ve created solo (with a little help from AI, of course! 🤖). It’s been such an exciting and rewarding challenge to bring my vision to life — and it’s just the beginning! 🚀
